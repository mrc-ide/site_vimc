Site acts as a translational layer between a site file and malariasimulation.

The site file is the file storing all of the context specific information for a site,
such as historical intervention coverage, seasonality, vectors etc. To simulate
a given site, we must convert this information into an input parameter list for
malaria simulation. That is what site is here to do!

If we have a correctly configured site file `example_site`, then all we need to 
do is create the parameter list and pass that to malariasimulation to run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
site <- example_site
site_par <- site_parameters(
  interventions = site$interventions,
  demography = site$demography,
  vectors = site$vectors,
  seasonality = site$seasonality,
  eir = site$eir,
  overrides = list(human_population = 10000)
)
site_sim <- malariasimulation::run_simulation(
  timesteps = site_par$timesteps,
  parameters = site_par
)

```

## Installation

You can install the development version of site from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/site")
```
